Pages:
- home (e.g. welcome to the Visual Arts Department at LJHS) <- index.html and app.js, outside of pages folder.
- gallery art club (our instagram is @galleryljhs)
- student artworks (like a virtual exhibition)
- the green dragon art show
- mural design

I think for rn I am just going to make the base title "Visual Arts LJHS" because department is too long. 

It also looks like gallery art club is like part of the visual arts department at LJHS, so probably just use that as a page title.
